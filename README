Use of at least one media type. Use audio from javascript.
Will play mpg or ogg based on what is supported.

Use of at least one HTML form type - e-mail type used in membership form.

Use of web fonts - used in myjumbotron class

Use of gradient - in myjunbotron class

Use of CSS3 correctly - In the last class, you said we could start with
			bootstrap. I hope I understood correctly. I started
			with one of their pages - I think it was jumbotron,
			which already had responsive css classes set up.

			I added a few additional in myjumbotron.css

			I added some media queries to change the jumbotron
			color when the screen size changes. It kinda works.

Works correctly on current release of all major desktop browsers - 
	Tried on Safari, Firefox, and Google Chrome. I have a mac
	and don't have the latest IE at work.

Works correctly in a tablet device - works on my 7" Galaxy tab. I don't have
	an I-pad.

Works correctly in a smart phone - tried in my Samsung and Blackberry - 
	well the page shows up, but doesn't work too well.
